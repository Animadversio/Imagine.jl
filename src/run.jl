#For USB-6002 devices that clock synchronization is not supported (see list of terminals).  bummer.
#strategy:  for the usb-6002 we can synchronize AO and AI starts by connecting the start-triggers with the PFI0 or PFI1 pins.  Note that the tasks will desynchronize over time since their
#clocks aren't synchronized
#note: with other boards we shouldn't need the PFI pins, maybe can just use the ao or ai start trigger terminals.  Then one needs to be triggered by software, the others can be triggered by its start sig.
#USB-6002 list of terminals (Ctr0Source is mysterious, probably useless) ["/Dev1/PFI0", "/Dev1/PFI1", "/Dev1/ai/StartTrigger", "/Dev1/ao/StartTrigger", "/Dev1/Ctr0Source"]
#will also implement another function that synchronizes the sample clocks of the two (and also of digital channels) for when this is used with a better DAQ
#   TODO: synchronize sample clocks for ai and ao tasks
